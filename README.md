Tools for easy level creation of a 2D game

I have taken advantage of the Unity's editor scripting capabilities, to create custom tools for easy level creation of a 2D game.
These tools allow the game designer to easily create levels, without having to write any code, using a custom made palette window
which includes all the available pieces to be added in the scene. Then all he has to do is click on the playspace grid.

The scene view has 4 modes: View, Paint, Erase and Edit

In View mode the user can pan arount the level freely.

In Paint mode the user can choose what to paint from the palette window and paint it by clicking and dragging at the grid.

In Erase mode the user erases pieces from the playspace grid.

In Edit mode the user can drag around a level piece and reposition it. More importantly, the user can choose a level piece
and review it's values or even change them.


Important:
Every prefab to be used must be at the "Assets/Prefabs/LevelPieces" path.
Automated asset management to be added.
